# SectorRotation
View the IPython notebook [here](https://github.com/andrew-dusa/SectorRotation/blob/main/SectorRotation.ipynb).

## Brief Summary
In this notebook we test two different Sector Rotation strategies, one based on picking the minimum variance sector ETF and holding for one month, and another based on picking the sector ETF with the highest one year return and holding for one month. We see that both strategies out perform in terms of returns but the minimum variance strategy provides a better sharpe ratio (risk-reward ratio).
